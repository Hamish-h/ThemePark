# ThemePark

Model a theme park and it's customers.

Using a Ride abstract class, create 2 or 3 rollercoaster type rides. Parameters could include price, min age/min height etc.

Using a Customer abstract class create instances of people to use the rides. Give them an age, height and money.

Allow the customers to interact with the rides (I.E. check they are tall/old enough) have them pay their money.


Possible extensions

Expand the model in whichever direction you like
